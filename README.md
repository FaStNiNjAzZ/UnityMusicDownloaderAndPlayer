# UnityMusicDownloaderAndPlayer
A small thing I made for my college project and decided to make it a Unity Package

I do not know if it works on any Unity versions below 2021.1.0f.

This particular package uses Newgrounds to get the songs. Potentially someone has or may make a similar thing for sites like YouTube or Soundcloud I don't know.

If I encounter any more bugs I may patch them but let me know if you find any!
